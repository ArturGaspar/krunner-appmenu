# krunner-appmenu
A KRunner plugin that shows the menu of the current application.

To install, copy appmenurunner.desktop to ~/.local/share/kservices5/ and krunner_appmenu.py	to ~/.config/autostart-scripts/ and ensure it has executable permissions. It also depends on Python 3.4, dbus-python and python-xlib.

(autostart-scripts is not ideal but it works)
